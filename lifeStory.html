          Born and raised in Ajax, I have always been a curious person. As a child, I always asked my parents ambitious questions,
          trying to learn everything I possibly could.

          Originally a shy child, I always did well in primary grades of school but my only motive was go home for extracurriculars.
          Driven by social interactions with friends, I was also introduced to video games at a young age when I got my first console.
          The PlayStation 1 put to sleep my Gameboy Colour, as I was now introduced to a large assortment of games.

          Belonging to the Ajax Minor Hockey Assosciation, and the Ajax Azzurri soccer club I always tried to find oppourtunities to volunteer.
          Within the AMHA, I volunteered throughout my teenage years to teach timbits (ages 4-5) the principals of hockey which taught me how to work with children.
          Once I turned 16, I was employed by the Ajax Azzurri soccer club to referee typically being under 12 boys or girls soccer matches.

          My casual employment experience begun with my employment at McDonalds Ajax, where I climbed all the way through the ranks from a team member
          to a swing manager in 4 years. McDonalds taught me a lot about customer experience, managing a fast-paced environment, and leadership.
          Throughout high school, I was attempting to balance hockey and 25+ hours a week at McDonalds all while trying to keep up a social life.

          As I grew up playing competitive hockey, I bounced around the tiers of AA to A. Once I got to grade 11, I decided I don't have the time to commit
          to hockey, as I wanted to make money and focus on my education. Luckily for me while I was in AE, these were the two years we won the Ontario Minor Hockey Association
          Championship.

          Meanwhile my childhood dreams were melting away as I concluded my last year of minor league hockey, I had to plan the next step in my life.
          It's probably one of the hardest things to answer as a Grade 11 or 12, "What are you doing after high school?". Being an avid gamer, and a
          spending more than a year of my life playing Runescape I assumed it'd have something to do with computers. Throughout my high school education,
          I took a course called "Computer Technology Engineering" where I excelled. Furthermore, I knew I was onto something special when an online course
          for Grade 12 on computer programming started with 65 students and I was one of the only three who didn't drop the class. My true passion for tech
          came from a project in Grade 12, where I created a Python simulation game of Risk using a Raspberry PI, GPIO buttons, and LEDs. Based on my
          passion for J.R.R Tolkien's works on the Lord of the Rings and other novels, I decided to theme it using the Lands of Arda.

          To conclude my path in high school, I was awarded the computer science excellence award at graduation and graduated with a suitable average grade
          to ensure my acceptance into various Universities. Following some scholarship offers, and acceptances from multiple Universities for computer science
          being a very family focused person I decided to go to a local University. Now begins the chapter of my time at the University of Ontario Institute of
          Technology.

          I can tell many stories about my time from 2015 - 2022 at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (also known as Ontario Tech University),
          but a lot of the fun parts can be found elsewhere on my website. Throughout my education, I always took initiative to take advantage of every
          oppourtunity put infront of me. By the time I was in my third year, I found myself both a teaching assistant and research assistant while balancing
          a full course load so it goes without saying I can handle a busy schedule. Once I began research in University, I became interested in doing a Bachelor's
          Honours thesis and pursuing a Master of Science degree. At this point in my education, I found a true passion for teaching but 
          oppourtunities for University instruction without a PhD is very far and few.
